authselect-migration - guide how to migrate from authconfig to authselect.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page explains the main differences between authconfig, the previous
tool to configure system authentication and identity sources, and authselect
which replaces it. It also explains what actions need to be done in order to
migrate from authconfig to authselect.

MAIN DIFFERENCES
----------------
Authselect takes a completely different approach to system configuration than
the previous tool authconfig.

Authconfig tries its best to keep user's manual changes to the files it
generates. It generates not only PAM and nsswitch.conf (to setup authentication
modules and identity sources) but it also generates simple configuration files
for several services such as LDAP and Kerberos.

Authselect does no such things. It does not generate any configuration files
beside PAM and nsswitch.conf and it strictly prohibits any manual changes to
generated configuration. It provides set of files called profiles. Each profile
describes how the resulting configuration should look like and it can be
slightly modified by enabling or disabling certain optional features. If a need
arise for a different profile than what authselect ships the administrator has
an option to create a whole new profile and than use it with authselect.
See authselect-profiles(5) to know more about profiles.

This may seem as a big disadvantage but the truth is the opposite. Authconfig is
a very old tool and the applications providing required services have changed
rapidly over the years. There is no longer need to have multiple authentication
modules in PAM and nsswitch.conf, therefore there is no need to add or remove
them specifically. There are also better tools to generate configuration for
system daemons that can help you automate the process of joining to a remote
domain. On the other hand, profiles give us comprehensive and deterministic
system configuration that can be fully tested a it is much less error prone. It
is also much easier to distribute such configuration across many systems.

Probably the most controversial change is that authselect ships only profiles
for sssd and winbind providers. Those two providers cover all modern use cases
from providing local users and legacy LDAP domain to complex configurations
with IPA or Active Directory servers. It does no longer contain support
for old nss-pam-ldapd and NIS and users are encouraged to switch to sssd.

JOINING REMOTE DOMAINS
----------------------
You can use either `ipa-client-install` or `realm` to join an IPA domain
and `realm` to join a Winbind domain. These tools will make sure that a correct
authselect profile is selected and all daemons and services are properly
configured.

CONVERTING YOUR SCRIPTS
-----------------------
If you use `ipa-client-install` or `realm` to join a domain, you can just
remove any authconfig call in your scripts. If this is not an option, you
need to replace each authconfig call with its equivalent authselect call
to select a correct profile with desired features. Then you also need to write
configuration file for required services.

CONFIGURATION FILES
-------------------
This sections contains snippets for minimal configuration of various services.

LDAP
~~~~
Even if LDAP is not directly used through `pam_ldap` and `nss_ldap` it is still
useful to configure ldap.conf to provide defaults for LDAP tools suchs as 
`ldapsearch`.

.@sysconfdir@/openldap/ldap.conf
----
# Set default base dn
BASE   dc=example,dc=com

# Set default LDAP server
URI    ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666
----

KERBEROS
~~~~~~~~
Kerberos realm must be configured to allow `kinit` if you use Kerberos.

.@sysconfdir@/krb5.conf
----
[libdefaults]
 default_realm = MYREALM

[realms]
 MYREALM = {
  kdc = kdc.myrealm.org
 }

[domain_realm]
 myrealm.org = MYREALM
 .myrealm.org = MYREALM
----

SSSD
~~~~
Authselect encourages users to use SSSD wherever possible. There are many
configuration options, see sssd.conf(5). This is a minimal configuration
that creates one LDAP domain called `default`. The LDAP server is
auto-discovered through DNS lookups.

.@sysconfdir@/sssd/sssd.conf
----
[sssd]
config_file_version = 2
domains = default

[domain/default]
id_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = _srv_
----

And here is a configuration snippet for the same domain but now the
authentication is done over Kerberos. The KDC server is auto-discovered through
DNS lookups.

.@sysconfdir@/sssd/sssd.conf
----
[sssd]
config_file_version = 2
domains = default

[domain/default]
id_provider = ldap
auth_provider = krb5
ldap_uri = _srv_
krb5_server = _srv_
krb5_realm = MYREALM
----

If you want to configure SSSD for an IPA or Active Directory domain use
`realm`. This will perform an initial setup which involves creating a
Kerberos keytab and generating basic SSSD configuration. You can then
tune it up by modifying @sysconfdir@/sssd/sssd.conf.

WINBIND
~~~~~~~
If you want to configure a Winbind domain use `realm`. This will perform an
initial setup which involves creating a Kerberos keytab and running `adcli`
to join the domain. It also makes changes to `smb.conf`. You can then
tune it up by modifying @sysconfdir@/samba/smb.conf.

PASSWORD QUALITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Authselect enables `pam_pwquality` module to enforce password quality
restrictions. This module is enabled only for local users. Remote users
use password policy that is defined within LDAP, IPA or Active Directory domain.

Module `pam_pwquality` can be configured in
@sysconfdir@/security/pwquality.conf. See pam_pwquality(8) to see its
configuration options and defaults.
