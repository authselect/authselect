"Authconfig tries its best to keep users's manual changes to the files it "
"generates. It generates not only PAM configuration files and nsswitch.conf "
"(to setup authentication modules and identity sources) but it also generates "
"simple configuration files for several services such as LDAP and Kerberos."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: src/man/authselect-migration.7.adoc:34
msgid ""
"Authselect does no such things. It does not generate any configuration files "
"beside PAM and nsswitch.conf and it strictly prohibits any manual changes to "
"generated configuration. It provides a set of files called profiles. Each "
"profile describes how the resulting configuration should look like and it "
"can be slightly modified by enabling or disabling certain optional features. "
"If a need arises for a different profile than what authselect ships, the "
"administrator has an option to create a whole new profile and use it with "
"authselect.  See authselect-profiles(5) to learn more about profiles."

msgid ""
"This may seem like a big disadvantage but the truth is the opposite. "
"Authconfig is a very old tool and the applications providing required "
"services have changed rapidly over the years. Typically, there is no longer "
"a need to have multiple authentication modules in PAM and nsswitch.conf, "
"because the vast majority of use-cases is covered by SSSD. Therefore there "
"is no need to add or remove them specifically. There are also better tools "
"to generate configuration for system daemons that can help you automate the "
"process of joining to a remote domain such as `realm`. In addition, the "
"shipped profiles give us comprehensive and deterministic system "
"configuration that can be fully tested and is much less error prone. It is "
"also much easier to distribute such configuration across many systems."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: src/man/authselect-migration.7.adoc:52

"Probably the most controversial change is that authselect only ships "
"profiles for sssd and winbind providers. Those two providers cover all "
"modern use cases from providing local users and legacy LDAP domain to "
"complex configurations with IPA or Active Directory servers. The profiles no "
"longer contain support for nss-pam-ldapd and users are encouraged to switch "
"to sssd."
