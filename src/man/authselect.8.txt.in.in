NAME
----

authselect - select system identity and authentication sources.

SYNOPSIS
--------
 authselect [--debug] [--trace] [--warn] command [command options] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Authselect* is a tool to configure system identity and authentication sources
and providers by selecting a specific profile. Profile is a set of files that
describes how the resulting system configuration will look like. When a profile
is selected, *authselect* will create nsswitch.conf(5) and PAM(8) stack to use
identity and authentication sources defined by the profile.

If the provided profile set is not sufficient, the administrator may create
a custom profile by putting it in a special profile directory
(@AUTHSELECT_PROFILE_DIR@/custom). By doing so, the profile is immediately
usable by *authselect*. See _authselect-profiles(5)_ for more information
on extending existing profiles.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
------------------
To list all available commands run *authselect* without any parameters.
To print help for selected command run *authselect COMMAND --help*.

*select* profile_id [features] [-f, --force]::
    Activate desired profile. If *--force* option is specified, *authselect*
    will try to write changes even if the previous configuration was not
    created by authconfig but by other tool or by manual changes. See profile
    description with *show* command, to list profile specific optional features.

*list*::
    List available profiles.

*show* profile_id::
    Print information about the profile.

*current*::
    Print information about currently selected profiles.

*check*::
    Check if the current configuration is valid (it was either created by
    *authselect* or there are no leftovers from previous authselect
    configuration).

*test* profile_id [features]::
    Print content of files generated by *authselect* without actually writing
    anything to system configuration.

COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
These options are available with all commands.

*--debug*::
    Print debugging information and error messages.

*--trace*::
    Print information about what the tool is doing.

*--warn*::
    Print information about unexpected situations that do not affect
    the program execution but may indicate some undesired situations
    (e.g. unexpected file in a profile directory).

GENERATED FILES
---------------
Authselect creates and maintains the following files to configure system
identity and authentication providers properly.

*@AUTHSELECT_NSSWITCH_CONF@*::
    Name Service Switch configuration file.

*@AUTHSELECT_PAM_DIR@/system-auth*::
    PAM stack that is included from nearly all individual service configuration
    files.

*@AUTHSELECT_PAM_DIR@/password-auth, smartcard-auth, fingerprint-auth*::
    These PAM stacks are for applications which handle authentication from
    different types of devices via simultaneously running individual
    conversations instead of one aggregate conversation.

*@AUTHSELECT_PAM_DIR@/postlogin*::
     The  purpose  of  this  PAM stack is to provide a common place for all
     PAM modules which should be called after the stack configured in
     system-auth or the other common PAM configuration files. It is included
     from all individual service configuration files that provide login service
     with shell or file access. _NOTE: the modules in the postlogin
     configuration file are executed regardless of the success or failure of
     the modules in the system-auth configuration file._

*@AUTHSELECT_DCONF_DIR@/@AUTHSELECT_DCONF_FILE@*::
    This file contains current configuration of gnome's _enable-smartcard-authentication_ and _enable-fingerprint-authentication_ dconf options to enable/disable these authentication types on gnome's login screen.

*@AUTHSELECT_DCONF_DIR@/locks/@AUTHSELECT_DCONF_FILE@*::
    This file creates lock on  gnome's _enable-smartcard-authentication_ and _enable-fingerprint-authentication_ dconf options.
