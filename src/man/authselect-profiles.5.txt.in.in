NAME
----
authselect-profiles - how to extend authselect profiles.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page explains how are authselect profiles organized and
how to create new profiles.

PROFILE DIRECTORIES
-------------------
Profiles can be found in one of three directories.

*@AUTHSELECT_PROFILE_DIR@/default*::
    Read-only directory containing profiles shipped together with authselect.

*@AUTHSELECT_PROFILE_DIR@/vendor*::
    Read-only directory for vendor-specific profiles that can override the
    ones in _default_ directory.

*@AUTHSELECT_PROFILE_DIR@/custom*::
    Place for administrator-defined profiles.

PROFILE FILES
-------------
Each profile consist of one or more of these files which provide
a mandatory profile description and describe the changes that are
done to the system. 

*README*::
    Description of the profile. The first line must be a name of the profile.

*system-auth*::
    PAM stack that is included from nearly all individual service configuration
    files.

*password-auth*, *smartcard-auth*, *fingerprint-auth*::
    These PAM stacks are for applications which handle authentication from
    different types of devices via simultaneously running individual
    conversations instead of one aggregate conversation.

*postlogin*::
     The  purpose  of  this  PAM stack is to provide a common place for all
     PAM modules which should be called after the stack configured in
     system-auth or the other common PAM configuration files. It is included
     from all individual service configuration files that provide login service
     with shell or file access. _NOTE: the modules in the postlogin
     configuration file are executed regardless of the success or failure of
     the modules in the system-auth configuration file._

*nsswitch.conf*::
    Name Service Switch configuration file.

CONDITIONAL LINES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each of these files serves as a template which can contain two types of
conditions that can modify resulting content.

*?argument:*::
    If the argument is provided to the profile, the next line following
    the condition is included to the file.
    
*??argument*::
    If the argument is not given, the rest of the file *is not* included
    to the result.
    
EXAMPLE
~~~~~~~
Here is an example of the first condition type. If with-sudo is provided
as an argument to the profile, _sudoers_ line is included in the resulting
nsswitch configuration. Otherwise is is left out.

  passwd:     sss files
  group:      sss files
  netgroup:   sss files
  automount:  sss files
  services:   sss files
  ?with-sudo:
  sudoers:    files sss
  
Here is an example of the second condition type. Unless with-smartcard is
given as an argument to the profile, the whole file will be empty.

  ??with-smartcard
  auth        required                                     pam_env.so
  auth        required                                     pam_faildelay.so delay=2000000
  auth        required                                     pam_faillock.so preauth silent deny=4 unlock_time=1200
  auth        [default=1 ignore=ignore success=ok]         pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet
  auth        [default=1 ignore=ignore success=ok]         pam_localuser.so
  auth        sufficient                                   pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
  auth        requisite                                    pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet_success
  auth        sufficient                                   pam_sss.so forward_pass
  auth        required                                     pam_faillock.so authfail deny=4 unlock_time=1200
  auth        required                                     pam_deny.so
  ...

CREATING A NEW PROFILE
----------------------
To register a new profile within authselect, create a directory in one of the
authselect profile locations with the files listed above. Not all of the files
must be present, only *README* is mandatory. Other files can be created on
per-need basis.
