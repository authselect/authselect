DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Authselect* is a tool to configure system identity and authentication sources and providers by selecting a specific profile. Profile is a set of files that describese how the resulting system configuration will look like. When a profile is selected, *authselect* will create nsswitch.conf(5) and PAM(8) stack to use identity and authentication sources defined by the profile.
