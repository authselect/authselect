NAME

authselect-profiles - how to extend authselect profiles.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page explains how are authselect profiles organized and
how to create new profiles.

PROFILE DIRECTORIES
-------------------
Profiles can be found in one of three directories.

*{AUTHSELECT_PROFILE_DIR}*::
    Read-only directory containing profiles shipped together with authselect.

*{AUTHSELECT_VENDOR_DIR}*::
    Read-only directory for vendor-specific profiles that can override the
    ones in _default_ directory.

*{AUTHSELECT_CUSTOM_DIR}*::
    Place for administrator-defined profiles.

PROFILE FILES
-------------
Each profile consists of one or more of these files which provide
a mandatory profile description and describe the changes that are
done to the system. 

*README*::
    Description of the profile. The first line must be a name of the profile.

*system-auth*::
    PAM stack that is included from nearly all individual service configuration
    files.

*password-auth*, *smartcard-auth*, *fingerprint-auth*::
    These PAM stacks are for applications which handle authentication from
    different types of devices via simultaneously running individual
    conversations instead of one aggregate conversation.

*postlogin*::
     The  purpose  of  this  PAM stack is to provide a common place for all
     PAM modules which should be called after the stack configured in
     system-auth or the other common PAM configuration files. It is included
     from all individual service configuration files that provide login service
     with shell or file access. _NOTE: the modules in the postlogin
     configuration file are executed regardless of the success or failure of
     the modules in the system-auth configuration file._

*nsswitch.conf*::
    Name Service Switch configuration file. Only maps relevant to the profile
    must be set. Maps that are not specified by the profile are included from
    {AUTHSELECT_CONFIG_DIR}/user-nsswitch.conf.

*dconf-db*::
    Changes to dconf database. The main uses case of this file is to set
    changes for gnome login screen in order to enable or disable smartcard
    and fingerprint authentication.

*dconf-locks*::
    This file define locks on values set in dconf database.

CONDITIONAL LINES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each of these files serves as a template. A template is a plain text file with
optional usage of several operators that can be used to provide some optional
profile features.

*{continue if "feature"}*::
    Immediately stop processing of the file unless "feature" is defined (the
    rest of the file content will be removed). If "feature" is defined, the
    whole line with this operator will be removed and the rest of the template
    will be processed.

*{stop if "feature"}*::
    Opposite of "continue if". Immediately stop processing of the file if
    "feature" is defined (the rest of the file content will be removed).
    If "feature" is not defined, the whole line with this operator will be
    removed and the rest of the template will be processed.

*{include if "feature"}*::
    Include the line where this operator is placed only if "feature" is
    defined.

*{exclude if "feature"}*::
    Opposite to "include-if". Include the line where this operator is placed
    only if "feature" is not defined.
    
*{if "feature":true|false}*::
    If "feature" is defined, replace this operator with string "true", otherwise
    with string "false".

*{if "feature":true}*::
    If "feature" is defined, replace this operator with string "true", otherwise
    with an empty string.

*{if not "feature":true|false}*::
    If "feature" is not defined, replace this operator with string "true",
    otherwise with string "false".
    
*{if not "feature":true}*::
    If "feature" is not defined, replace this operator with string "true",
    otherwise with an empty string.
    
EXAMPLE
~~~~~~~
Here is an example of using "if" operator. If "with-sudo" feature is enabled,
it will add "sss" to sudoers line.

  passwd:     sss files
  group:      sss files
  netgroup:   sss files
  automount:  sss files
  services:   sss files
  sudoers:    files {if "with-sudo":sss}
  
Here is an example of "continue-if" and "include-if" operators. The resulting
file will be empty unless "with-smartcard" feature is enabled. If it is enabled
and also "with-faillock" feature is enabled, it will also enable support
for pam_faillock.

  {continue if "with-smartcard"}
  auth        required                                     pam_env.so
  auth        required                                     pam_faildelay.so delay=2000000
  auth        required                                     pam_faillock.so preauth silent deny=4 unlock_time=1200 {include if "with-faillock"}
  auth        [default=1 ignore=ignore success=ok]         pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet
  auth        [default=1 ignore=ignore success=ok]         pam_localuser.so
  auth        sufficient                                   pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
  auth        requisite                                    pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet_success
  auth        sufficient                                   pam_sss.so forward_pass
  auth        required                                     pam_faillock.so authfail deny=4 unlock_time=1200       {include if "with-faillock"}
  auth        required                                     pam_deny.so
  ...

CREATING A NEW PROFILE
----------------------
To register a new profile within authselect, create a directory in one of the
authselect profile locations with the files listed above. Not all of the files
must be present, only *README* is mandatory. Other files can be created on
per-need basis.
