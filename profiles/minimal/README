Local users only for minimal installations
==========================================

Selecting this profile will enable local files as the source of identity
and authentication providers.

This profile can be used on systems that require minimal installation to
save disk and memory space. It serves only local users and groups directly
from system files instead of going through other authentication providers.
Therefore SSSD, winbind and fprintd packages can be safely removed.

Unless this system has strict memory and disk constraints, it is recommended
to keep SSSD running and use 'sssd' profile to avoid functional limitations.
