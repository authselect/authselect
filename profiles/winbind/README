Enable winbind for system authentication
========================================

Selecting this profile will enable Samba's winbind as the source of identity
and authentication providers.

The Samba standard Windows interoperability suite of utilities allows Linux
systems to join an Active Directory environment by making them appear to be
Windows clients. As a means of systems integration, Samba allows a Linux
client to join an Active Directory Kerberos realm and to use Active Directory
as its identity store.

Winbind is a component of the Samba suite to provide unified logon. It uses a 
UNIX implementation of Microsoft RPC calls, Pluggable Authentication
Modules (PAMs), and the Name Service Switch (NSS) to allow Windows domain
users to appear and operate as UNIX users on a UNIX system. 

WINBIND CONFIGURATION
---------------------

Authselect does not touch winbind's configuration. Please, read winbind's
documentation to see how to configure it manually. Only local users will be
available on the system if there is no existing winbind configuration.

AVAILABLE OPTIONAL FEATURES
---------------------------

with-faillock::
    Enable account locking in case of too many consecutive
    authentication failures.
    
with-mkhomedir::
    Enable automatic creation of home directories for users on their
    first login.

with-ecryptfs::
    Enable automatic per-user ecryptfs.

with-fingerprint::
    Enable authentication with fingerprint reader through *pam_fprintd*.

with-pam-u2f::
    Enable authentication via u2f dongle through *pam_u2f*.

with-pam-u2f-2fa::
    Enable 2nd factor authentication via u2f dongle through *pam_u2f*.

with-krb5::
    Enable Kerberos authentication with *pam_winbind*.

with-winbind-cache::
    Enable authentication cache with *pam_winbind*.

with-krb5-cache::
    Enable kerberos credential cache with *pam_winbind*.

with-silent-lastlog::
    Do not produce pam_lastlog message during login.

with-pamaccess::
    Check access.conf during account authorization.

without-nullok::
    Do not add nullok parameter to pam_unix.

DISABLE SPECIFIC NSSWITCH DATABASES
-----------------------------------

Normally, nsswitch databases set by the profile overwrites values set in
user-nsswitch.conf. The following options can force authselect to
ignore value set by the profile and use the one set in user-nsswitch.conf
instead.

with-custom-passwd::
Ignore "passwd" database set by the profile.

with-custom-group::
Ignore "group" database set by the profile.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Enable winbind with no additional modules

  authselect select winbind

* Enable winbind and create home directories for users on their first login

  authselect select winbind with-mkhomedir
