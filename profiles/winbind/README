Enable winbind for system authentication
========================================

Selecting this profile will enable Samba's winbind as the source of identity
and authentication providers.

The Samba standard Windows interoperability suite of utilities allows Linux
systems to join an Active Directory environment by making them appear to be
Windows clients. As a means of systems integration, Samba allows a Linux
client to join an Active Directory Kerberos realm and to use Active Directory
as its identity store.

Winbind is a component of the Samba suite to provide unified logon. It uses a
UNIX implementation of Microsoft RPC calls, Pluggable Authentication
Modules (PAMs), and the Name Service Switch (NSS) to allow Windows domain
users to appear and operate as UNIX users on a UNIX system.

WINBIND CONFIGURATION
---------------------

Authselect does not touch winbind's configuration. Please, read winbind's
documentation to see how to configure it manually. Only local users will be
available on the system if there is no existing winbind configuration.

AVAILABLE OPTIONAL FEATURES

    authentication failures.
