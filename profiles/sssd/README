Enable SSSD for system authentication
=====================================

Selecting this profile will enable SSSD as the source of identity
and authentication providers.

SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories
and authentication mechanisms such as LDAP, Kerberos or FreeIPA. It provides
an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system
to connect to multiple different account sources.

More information about SSSD can be found on its project page:
https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd

SSSD CONFIGURATION
------------------

Authselect does not touch SSSD's configuration. Please, read SSSD's
documentation to see how to configure it manually. Only local users
will be available on the system if there is no existing SSSD configuration.

AVAILABLE OPTIONAL FEATURES
---------------------------

with-faillock::
    Enable account locking in case of too many consecutive
    authentication failures.
    
with-mkhomedir::
    Enable automatic creation of home directories for users on their
    first login.

with-ecryptfs::
    Enable automatic per-user ecryptfs.

with-sudo::
    Use SSSD as a source of sudo rules.

with-smartcard::
    Enable authentication with smartcards through SSSD. Please note that
    smartcard support must be also explicitly enabled within
    SSSD's configuration.

with-smartcard-lock-on-removal::
    Lock screen when a smartcard is removed.

with-fingerprint::
    Enable authentication with fingerprint reader through *pam_fprintd*.
