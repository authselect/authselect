Enable NIS for system authentication
====================================

Selecting this profile will enable Network Information Services as the source
of identity and authentication providers.

NIS CONFIGURATION
-----------------

Authselect does not touch NIS configuration. Please, read NIS' documentation
to see how to configure it manually.

AVAILABLE OPTIONAL FEATURES
---------------------------

with-faillock::
    Enable account locking in case of too many consecutive
    authentication failures.

with-mkhomedir::
    Enable automatic creation of home directories for users on their
    first login.

with-ecryptfs::
    Enable automatic per-user ecryptfs.

with-fingerprint::
    Enable authentication with fingerprint reader through *pam_fprintd*.

with-silent-lastlog::
    Do not produce pam_lastlog message during login.

with-pamaccess::
    Check access.conf during account authorization.

with-nispwquality::
    If this option is set pam_pwquality module will check password quality
    for NIS users as well as local users during password change. Without this
    option only local users passwords are checked.

    Do not add nullok parameter to pam_unix.

DISABLE SPECIFIC NSSWITCH DATABASES
-----------------------------------

ignore value set by the profile and use the one set in user-nsswitch.conf
instead.
